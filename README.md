    <!-- Hi there! This is my portfolio. I'm really excited to showcase my development skills up to now. I'm getting the hang of using Bootstrap, CSS, Grid design, HTML5 semantics, and so much more. I'm amazed how much I've learned in the past two weeks. -->

    <!-- The reason why I decided to enroll in this bootcamp is that I realized how much more work needs to be done in helping bridge gaps in logistics, particularly in electoral politics and in health care. These two industries are hugely important to me, and I'm really excited to use this portfolio to share about my background and how I plan to use this in my career. -->

    <!--Since college, I've worked in and out of politics, in particular, political campaigns. There are so many roadblocks in getting people to vote and build political pressure around issues that they're passionate about. My web development skills will enable me to create tools that better engage voters with their local community, campaigns, and so much more. I belive in building tools that bridge people to one another, upon foundations of trust, knowledge, and unified values.-->

    <!--Aside from politics, it goes without saying that our healh care system has revealed itself in the last few months to be extremely fragile. This pandemic has taught us all that basic medical equipment and expertise cannot fight a contagious viral disease. With better logistics, tools, and connectivity, there are so many opportunities to improve processes in how hospitals procure supplies, equipment, and above all, protective gear to outfit our  heroic health care workers.-->

    <!--In general, I really want this portfolio to build the groundwork for showcasing what I can do. The projects I'm going to build need to prove to future employers that I'm a professionally trained coder, capable of whatever is thrown my way. Above all, I really want my portfolio to exude my passions for politics and healthcare logistics.-->
